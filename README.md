# Interface Design
## Assignment 6: UX Interface Design with Figma
Patrick Khoury | DH110 | Fall 2022 | Dr. Sookie Cho

## Project Description

This project will promote efficiency and convenience for user sustainability efforts by consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application, presented as a social media platform. The aforementioned activities and services would be geared towards target users’ needs and daily lifestyle; for example, including carpooling, thrifting/clothing swaps, furniture repurposing, sustainability events, etc. In this way, my project will mainly support users in gaining an environmentally-conscious community and lowering barriers to access for information about related activities and services.

The purpose of this interface design is to convert the previously created low-fidelity designs into a digitized design with carefully selected graphic variations (i.e. typographic variation, shape variation, color variation, etc). Furthermore, graphic principles such as readability, user comprehension, and general accessibility were also prioritized in this process. The process of digitizing my low-fidelity design was done through the online interface design tool, Figma. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 14 Pro Max screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, Spark, Adobe Color, Material Design, and other online information sources. User interface is vital in meeting user expectations, as the program’s design plays a huge role in its functionality and overall appeal.

  - Includes test screens, final iterations, digitized wireframes and wireflow, color contrast check, color wheel, and saved color and text styles.


#### Initial Wireframe of the "Ride" Page that I will design:

Initial Wireframe from Low Fidelity Prototype Phase.


### Decision Process
In the following analysis, I will highlight the graphical user interface design variations made on a singular wireframe in my interface design. The wireframe I will be featuring in this analysis is the general “Rides” page on the application. I chose to use this page rather than any others as it features a combination of icons, buttons, and several forms of text and layers. Furthermore, the Rides page is one of the central pages on the application and is able to be accessed from the home page directly after opening the app. The features available on the Ride page is also central to the functionality of the application. Digitizing the Rides page and creating this graphic design system will aid me in creating additional pages to my application, as the presets for the texts and colors are programmed into the document. The finalized light and dark mode of the Rides page is shown below:

## Overall Layout

Creating a proper overall layout grid is essential to intelligently organizing information and controlling spacing in the interface. The layout grid is the foundation of the application and is made up of rows, columns, margins, and gutters. I organized the information according to this layout grid as shown below.

### Decision Process and Design Details
I created 16 rows and 5 columns with gutters of 20px and margins of 77px and 10px for the rows and columns respectively. I chose to include 16 rows in my layout as I had 16 elements of text at different y-axis locations inside the two information boxes. Margins of 77px would allow me to tightly encompass the two rectangles into the layout, allowing me to equally and efficiently space out my text in the two boxes. I chose to include 5 columns because of the 5 navigation icons on the bottom of the page. I had elements that needed to be centered directly and elements I wanted to separate according to the equally spaced icons on the bottom of the screen. A margin in 10px in this case would allow me to properly format any elements close to the edge of the screen. I abided by the principles of Gestalt theory *link* to organize any visual elements in my design.


## Typography Variations

Typography in interface promotes legibility, communicates tone and sentiment, and delivers an aesthetic effect perceived almost instantly by the user. Typography is one of the first things noticed in interface design, and it is one of the most important. In the following iterations, I utilized information and advice from Google Fonts *link*, Material Design *link*, Smashing Magazine *link*, and Looka *link.

### Decision Process and Design Details
For typography, I wanted a look that is fun yet professional. First, I tried using the Quicksand font because it has a young, fun appearance with the rounded corners and different boldness options. Second, I tested the Spectral font, which had a much more professional look. After these two tests, I felt that Quicksand appeared slightly too disorganized/unprofessional, and Spectral appeared too formal. I researched more fonts through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and found that Roboto Slab was a happy medium of these two fonts. Using Roboto Slab for every text item on the application was a bit much, so I mixed in Roboto for subtitles, and used Playfair Display for the main app title. My final topography is shown at the very right in the image above. Details for these fonts are below.

| Text | Typeface | Font Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main Title (H1) | Playfair Display | 54px | Bold |
| Lesson Title (H2) | Roboto Slab | 34px | Regular |
| Lesson Subtitle (H3) | Roboto | 20px | Light Italic |
| Button Label (H4) | Roboto Slab | 24px | Regular |
| Status Percent (H6) | Roboto | 11px | Light |


## Shape Variations

Shapes can be used to reflect a specific purpose or meaning. Text or icons can help reinforce that meaning when the shape of a surface alone could be ambiguous. I created 3 different shape scheme iterations using the guidance provided by Material Design *link*.

### Decision Process and Design Details
- For my first iteration, I added a rectangle in the background of the text to accentuate the information and actions listed on this page. I also created four rectangular action buttons inside the larger rectangle. 
- In my second iteration, I wanted to separate the large rectangle into two separate ones to indicate the two separate options: carpooling and commute groups. I did this in my second iteration and carefully extended the width of both boxes. I wanted my boxes to be wide enough to handle the amount of text written, but have large enough margins to be able to easily read the edges of the information.
- In my final iteration, I wanted to account for the possibility of larger fingers on a small screen. Because of this, I further separated the find button from the share button and the join button from the create button respectively. Furthermore, I wanted my design to look both modern and fun. Thus, I rounded the corners of the larger rectangles to 10 corner radius and the buttons to 20 corner radius. Rounding the corners makes the application feel more light-hearted, while preventing the page from looking outdated. I wanted to make the buttons seem 3D as an additional indicator that the buttons are clickable, so I added a drop shadow effect onto them. 


## Color Scheme Variation:

A color scheme is one of the first elements to communicate the message behind the design on both visual and psychological levels. When creating my color scheme I referenced the principles outlined by Material Design. Furthermore, I wanted to keep constant with the environmental theme, so I decided to primarily focus on Earth colors and tones. I created two iterations each for a light and dark mode version of my application.

### Light Mode

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114698093/200815603-cecc1fc7-d00d-49c2-926d-27b0a8ceddd0.png)

### Decision Process and Design Details
- My first iteration of the color scheme for the light mode features a light blue background, offwhite rectangular text backgrounds, and a sage green navigation bar and buttons. This scheme was based on colors representing the daytime sky, clouds, and grass. Although I liked the color scheme, I didn’t love the selection of colors for each element and wanted to change it up.
- For the final iteration I wanted to build off the scheme I created in the first draft. I lightened up the blue and green to better represent the sky and grass. Furthermore, I switched up the selection of colors for each element. The background of the light mode is now a light green, and the text background is now a light blue. The navigation and buttons are offwhite with black icons and text.

### Color Wheel

### Accessibility / Color Contrast Check

### Dark Mode

### Decision Process and Design Details
- My first iteration of the color scheme for the dark mode features a black background, dark blue rectangular text backgrounds, and a sage green navigation bar and buttons. This color scheme was the night version of my first light mode iteration. The selections are meant to come together to represent the sights one would see in nature at night. Although I liked this general scheme, it didn’t scream nature to me so I decided to make a few adjustments. 
- My final iteration of the color scheme varied significantly from the first. Although the background color remains the same, the colors of the text background and navigation bar/buttons have changed dramatically. I chose jungle green for the navigation bar and button, as I felt like it contrasted well with the white icons and text. I made the text backgrounds brown, as the combination with the jungle green reminded me of trees at night.

- I created 16 rows and 5 columns with gutters of 20px and margins of 77px and 10px for the rows and columns respectively. I chose to include 16 rows in my layout as I had 16 elements of text at different y-axis locations inside the two information boxes. Margins of 77px would allow me to tightly encompass the two rectangles into the layout, allowing me to equally and efficiently space out my text in the two boxes. I chose to include 5 columns because of the 5 navigation icons on the bottom of the page. I had elements that needed to be centered directly and elements I wanted to separate according to the equally spaced icons on the bottom of the screen. A margin in 10px in this case would allow me to properly format any elements close to the edge of the screen. I abided by the principles of Gestalt theory *link* to organize any visual elements in my design.


## Impression Test
In order to conduct an impression test for my newly-designed Rides page, I created a two-part survey using Usabilityhub and invited a friend that fits within the target user demographic to take the test. The test-taker recorded her screen and audio commentary while going through the survey, as well as submitted her feedback for the site to compile. The first part of the survey included a 5 second impression test, where my Rides page was displayed to the test-taker for only 5 seconds before asking for a description of what she remembered and what purpose she thought the application could serve. The second part of the survey included a design survey, wherein the test taker was provided with contextual information about the application and was allowed to reference the Rides page while providing feedback. Questions were focused on understanding what design elements the test-taker liked and disliked, as well as what emotions she felt in interacting with the page. In this way, I was able to see what a potential user’s first impressions of the page might be, as well as gain specific feedback on whether the look and feel of the page’s design fit the larger intention behind the application.

Video file of screen recording and audio commentary linked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Zx_8kg90X-Rh0u-f3vDsOs4wmYZ5NvZ/view?usp=sharing).

### Summary of Findings:
Based on results for the "What is this app used for" question, the top impressions users noted were music, learning, tuning, and reading. It was interesting to see that many users believed the app's purpose was for tuning instruments. I think that this was a common answer because the app name is "TuneMate". Perhaps I should consider exploring other name options for the application, because the word "Tune" might be misleading for the app's purpose. However, "music" and "learning" were the most popular answers, which tells me that the main purpose of the app was conveyed to most users. Based on results for the word/sentence recall question, most users recalled rhythm, reading, fundamentals, and basic. These results demonstrated that the overall lesson names really stood out to users.

### Observations
Overall, I was quite pleased with how the impression test and design survey went. Within only 5 seconds, the test-taker was able to identify that the Rides page was part of an application that combined ride sharing with other functions. She also was able to identify the two different options for Carpool and Commute Group functions, demonstrating to me that separating them out into different boxes was the right choice with regards to page design, as the two separate boxes allowed her to quickly determine that there are two separate options for Rides. In addition, I was also pleased to see that she made the connection between application purpose and the color scheme being geared towards Earth-toned, fresh colors. This also contributed to the feeling of calmness that the test-taker reported feeling, which was important to me to develop, as test users in previous assignments noted that sustainability efforts tend to feel high-stress and pessimistic. Lastly, the test-taker noted that the icons and their respective labels, as well as the text descriptions, allowed her to feel a sense of excitement and confidence in reviewing the page — she noted that she felt like these design components allowed her to feel “the opposite of frustration” in knowing what to expect. However, she did note that the Title font might look too sharp for the application. This sharpness is because I chose a combination of serif font for the headers and san serif font for body text in my final typography iteration. In this case, one fix might be to pick a serif header with less “sharp” features, or potentially to abandon the mixed aesthetic and pick a sans serif font for the header as well. Ultimately, however, I was very satisfied with how the final Rides page performed in both the 5 second impression test and the design survey questions.

## Transcript:
Part 1: 5 Second Impression Test
Q1. Could you describe what you remember seeing?
Mobile app - Rides title at top, two blue squares with Carpool and Commuting functions — two buttons in the blue boxes, toolbar at bottom
Q2. What do you think the purpose of this application is?
Multipurpose — Ride sharing plus other functions (home / profile / shop?)

Part 2: Design Survey Questions
This screen is the Rides page of a social media application, designed to make sustainable living more efficient and accessible.

Q1. Which parts of the design do you like and dislike? Q2. What feelings does this page evoke?
Dislike: Title / Header font (Rides, Carpool) looks too sharp
Like: Icons are straightforward, easy to understand; text descriptors are really useful in differentiating function; color scheme is good for sustainability app.
Feelings: calm, fresh, relaxed, ease of use; descriptors make you feel excited to use the different functions and feel like you know what to expect (not frustrated and confused.)
