# Interface Design
## Assignment 6: UX Interface Design with Figma
Patrick Khoury | DH110 | Fall 2022 | Dr. Sookie Cho

## Project Description

This project will promote efficiency and convenience for user sustainability efforts by consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application, presented as a social media platform. The aforementioned activities and services would be geared towards target users’ needs and daily lifestyle; for example, including carpooling, thrifting/clothing swaps, furniture repurposing, sustainability events, etc. In this way, my project will mainly support users in gaining an environmentally-conscious community and lowering barriers to access for information about related activities and services.

The purpose of this interface design is to convert the previously created low-fidelity designs into a digitized design with carefully selected graphic variations (i.e. typographic variation, shape variation, color variation, etc). Furthermore, graphic principles such as readability, user comprehension, and general accessibility were also prioritized in this process. The process of digitizing my low-fidelity design was done through the online interface design tool, Figma. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 14 Pro Max screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, Spark, Adobe Color, Material Design, and other online information sources. User interface is vital in meeting user expectations, as the program’s design plays a huge role in its functionality and overall appeal.

### Decision Process
In the following analysis, I will highlight the graphical user interface design variations made on a singular wireframe in my interface design. The wireframe I will be featuring in this analysis is the general “Rides” page on the application. I chose to use this page rather than any others as it features a combination of icons, buttons, and several forms of text and layers. Furthermore, the Rides page is one of the central pages on the application and is able to be accessed from the home page directly after opening the app. The features available on the Ride page is also central to the functionality of the application. Digitizing the Rides page and creating this graphic design system will aid me in creating additional pages to my application, as the presets for the texts and colors are programmed into the document. 

## Overall Layout

### Decision Process and Design Details
For typography, I wanted a look that is fun yet professional. First, I tried using the Quicksand font because it has a young, fun appearance with the rounded corners and different boldness options. Second, I tested the Spectral font, which had a much more professional look. After these two tests, I felt that Quicksand appeared slightly too disorganized/unprofessional, and Spectral appeared too formal. I researched more fonts through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and found that Roboto Slab was a happy medium of these two fonts. Using Roboto Slab for every text item on the application was a bit much, so I mixed in Roboto for subtitles, and used Playfair Display for the main app title. My final topography is shown at the very right in the image above. Details for these fonts are below.

### Decision Process and Design Details
I tested three button variations: rectangle with slightly rounded corners, rectangle with one circular corner, and rectangle with fully rounded corners. While I thought that the one circular corner option was unique, I felt that it had too much movement in the design. I decided to go with the slightly rounded corner option, because the buttons appeared more stable and stationary. This stationary look is what I feel goes best with learning-topic-buttons. Details for this design are below:

| Text | Typeface | Font Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main Title (H1) | Playfair Display | 54px | Bold |
| Lesson Title (H2) | Roboto Slab | 34px | Regular |
| Lesson Subtitle (H3) | Roboto | 20px | Light Italic |
| Button Label (H4) | Roboto Slab | 24px | Regular |
| Status Percent (H6) | Roboto | 11px | Light |


## Shape Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
I accessed these chat icons from [Icons8.com](https://icons8.com/). However, if I had more time on this part of my project, I would have designed each icon by hand. These were the top four chat icons I liked from the site. I tested two round chat shapes, one rectangular chat shape, and one multi-chat icon. When testing these icons, I felt that the circle shape was too tall and looked unprofessional. I appreciated the rectangular icon, but it appeared slightly too square for the overall look. Thus, I decided to use the ovular chat shape because it has less height, but still has roundness. This is seen in the second frame in the image above. The icon image measures 36px by 27px.

## Color Scheme Variation: Light Mode

### Decision Process and Design Details
As I continued to look at my design, I felt it needed a more clear grouping of elements. Based on [Gestalt Theory](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#composition), both implicit containment and explicit containment can help improve a design's visual grouping. I decided to create a unique shape to add movement and create explicit containment around the top section of the screen. Details for the shape design are documented under [Design Summary](#design-summary). I then utilized my original grid layout to ensure that the elements were still spaced properly. Lastly, I added a drop-shadow to the buttons and rounded the corners of the status bars (2px). The final design is shown in the rightmost frame in the image above.

## Color Scheme Variation: Dark Mode

### Decision Process and Design Details
I tested several different color variations. Six are shown above. To help me decide color schemes, I used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) for color combinations and [Visme](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/) for further inspiration. I tested Analagous, Complementary, Monochromatic, and Primary color combinations. Different shades and hues were used to color the individual components of the design. I researched more about color psychology, specifically for [color in branding](https://www.ignytebrands.com/the-psychology-of-color-in-branding/#3), and found that blue and purple hues are what I would like to use for my music learning app. Blue instills a sense of dependability, logic, serenity, and security. Whereas purple instills a sense of wisdom, imagination, and sophistication. I decided to test more variations of the monochromatic indigo design in the bottom left frame shown above.

Layout: 
- I created 16 rows and 5 columns with gutters of 20px and margins of 77px and 10px for the rows and columns respectively. I chose to include 16 rows in my layout as I had 16 elements of text at different y-axis locations inside the two information boxes. Margins of 77px would allow me to tightly encompass the two rectangles into the layout, allowing me to equally and efficiently space out my text in the two boxes. I chose to include 5 columns because of the 5 navigation icons on the bottom of the page. I had elements that needed to be centered directly and elements I wanted to separate according to the equally spaced icons on the bottom of the screen. A margin in 10px in this case would allow me to properly format any elements close to the edge of the screen. I abided by the principles of Gestalt theory *link* to organize any visual elements in my design.


## Impression Test
In order to conduct an impression test for my newly-designed Rides page, I created a two-part survey using Usabilityhub and invited a friend that fits within the target user demographic to take the test. The test-taker recorded her screen and audio commentary while going through the survey, as well as submitted her feedback for the site to compile. The first part of the survey included a 5 second impression test, where my Rides page was displayed to the test-taker for only 5 seconds before asking for a description of what she remembered and what purpose she thought the application could serve. The second part of the survey included a design survey, wherein the test taker was provided with contextual information about the application and was allowed to reference the Rides page while providing feedback. Questions were focused on understanding what design elements the test-taker liked and disliked, as well as what emotions she felt in interacting with the page. In this way, I was able to see what a potential user’s first impressions of the page might be, as well as gain specific feedback on whether the look and feel of the page’s design fit the larger intention behind the application.

### Summary of Findings:
Based on results for the "What is this app used for" question, the top impressions users noted were music, learning, tuning, and reading. It was interesting to see that many users believed the app's purpose was for tuning instruments. I think that this was a common answer because the app name is "TuneMate". Perhaps I should consider exploring other name options for the application, because the word "Tune" might be misleading for the app's purpose. However, "music" and "learning" were the most popular answers, which tells me that the main purpose of the app was conveyed to most users. Based on results for the word/sentence recall question, most users recalled rhythm, reading, fundamentals, and basic. These results demonstrated that the overall lesson names really stood out to users.

### Observations
Overall, I was quite pleased with how the impression test and design survey went. Within only 5 seconds, the test-taker was able to identify that the Rides page was part of an application that combined ride sharing with other functions. She also was able to identify the two different options for Carpool and Commute Group functions, demonstrating to me that separating them out into different boxes was the right choice with regards to page design, as the two separate boxes allowed her to quickly determine that there are two separate options for Rides. In addition, I was also pleased to see that she made the connection between application purpose and the color scheme being geared towards Earth-toned, fresh colors. This also contributed to the feeling of calmness that the test-taker reported feeling, which was important to me to develop, as test users in previous assignments noted that sustainability efforts tend to feel high-stress and pessimistic. Lastly, the test-taker noted that the icons and their respective labels, as well as the text descriptions, allowed her to feel a sense of excitement and confidence in reviewing the page — she noted that she felt like these design components allowed her to feel “the opposite of frustration” in knowing what to expect. However, she did note that the Title font might look too sharp for the application. This sharpness is because I chose a combination of serif font for the headers and san serif font for body text in my final typography iteration. In this case, one fix might be to pick a serif header with less “sharp” features, or potentially to abandon the mixed aesthetic and pick a sans serif font for the header as well. Ultimately, however, I was very satisfied with how the final Rides page performed in both the 5 second impression test and the design survey questions.

## Transcript:
Part 1: 5 Second Impression Test
Q1. Could you describe what you remember seeing?
Mobile app - Rides title at top, two blue squares with Carpool and Commuting functions — two buttons in the blue boxes, toolbar at bottom
Q2. What do you think the purpose of this application is?
Multipurpose — Ride sharing plus other functions (home / profile / shop?)

Part 2: Design Survey Questions
This screen is the Rides page of a social media application, designed to make sustainable living more efficient and accessible.

Q1. Which parts of the design do you like and dislike? Q2. What feelings does this page evoke?
Dislike: Title / Header font (Rides, Carpool) looks too sharp
Like: Icons are straightforward, easy to understand; text descriptors are really useful in differentiating function; color scheme is good for sustainability app.
Feelings: calm, fresh, relaxed, ease of use; descriptors make you feel excited to use the different functions and feel like you know what to expect (not frustrated and confused.)
